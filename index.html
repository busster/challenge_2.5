		<p>Vaporwave is a genre of music/ art movement that originated on internet forums such as tumblr and reddit in early 2010. Because it was born online, it has no real origins and is considered the first genre of music to be completely globalized. The genre began as an aesthetic obsessed with 80's and 90's subculture. It was inspired by and contrived using glitch art, early digital graphic design, roman busts, tropical landscapes, japenese culture, and nostalgic television ads.</p>

		<p>The word vaporwave comes from a	combination of vaporware: a	business term to describe a product that is announced to the public but never actually released or canceled, and a markist term to describe the perpetual repetition of ideals that are not concrete in their philosophy. This is also described as waves of vapor.	The permeating theme of vaporwave is its critique/ mockery of consumer capitalism. This because it was a glorification of stealing other people's art and marketing it under a new title in foreign languages. Other themes include the globalization of internet culture, and sweet sweet 80's elevator musak. It has been dubbed a digital punk movement with ideals that counter the concepts of ownership by making vaporwave anonymous art for anonymous people.
